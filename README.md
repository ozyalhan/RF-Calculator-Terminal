# RF-Calculator-Terminal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This program has a purpose that makes easier to understand of RF/Microwave Terms: 
 
 - RL    Return Loss
- VSWR  Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
- Γ     Reflection Coefficient
- ML    Mismatch Loss

For example, choose RL mode, enter the value and get results of VSWR, Reflection Coefficient and ML.

Program has also RL calculator that get inputs of Pi(İncident Power) and Pr(reflected power) as Watt or dBm, calculate the return loss value as DB.


### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ozyalhan/RF-Calculator-Terminal.git
$ cd RF-Calculator-Terminal
$ python RF-calculator.py
```

### Todos

 - Write Tests With All Cases
 - Turn the Program in OOP principles
 - Create the system to Web with Flask
